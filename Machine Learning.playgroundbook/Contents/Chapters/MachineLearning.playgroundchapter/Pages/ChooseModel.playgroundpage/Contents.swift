 ## Choosing Model
 The next step in our workflow is choosing a model. There are many models that researchers and data scientists have created over the years. Some are very well suited for image data, others for sequences (like text, or music), some for numerical data, others for text-based data.
 
 We can choose one of the models among the following -
 
 * Image Model
 * Music Model
 * Text Model
 
 Pass the name of the model in the chooseModel function to select one of the models.
 
 Hint: chooseModel("imageModel")

let object = MachineLearning()
// object.chooseModel("textModel")
