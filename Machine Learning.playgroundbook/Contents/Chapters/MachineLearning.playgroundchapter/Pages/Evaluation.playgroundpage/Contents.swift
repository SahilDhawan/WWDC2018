 ## Evaluation
 Once training is complete, itâ€™s time to see if the model is any good, using Evaluation. This is where that dataset that we set aside earlier comes into play. Evaluation allows us to test our model against data that has never been used for training. This metric allows us to see how the model might perform against data that it has not yet seen. This is meant to be representative of how the model might perform in the real world.

 ## Prediction
 Machine learning is using data to answer questions. So Prediction, or inference, is the step where we get to answer some questions. This is the point of all this work, where the value of machine learning is realized.
